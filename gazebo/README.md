# Gazebo Joints
	Joints are used to connect two bodies and give their connection specified degrees of freedom.
	To apply force on joint, use the apply force tab on the left hand side of the GUI and give the joint desired force.

### Note
	Gazebo version 7 crashes when using the joint creator window, so save your file before opening the joint window.
